        <h1>Local Area Network (LAN)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>When your laptop or mobile phone is connected into your home or office network, you’re using what’s known as the local area network (LAN).</p>
        <p>A LAN is a proprietary computer network that enables designated users to have exclusive access to the same system connection at a common location, always within an area of less than a mile and most often within the same building. By doing so they’re able to share devices, share resources such as printers, and exchange information as if they were all working from the same system. Resource sharing is possible with a network-aware operating system.</p>
        <p>Originally used in universities and research labs, today LANs are in use everywhere, including in the home and business. With the use of coaxial cables, optical fiber cables, or twisted wire pair, different types of network topologies, such as bus, star, and branching tree are used to fulfill specific goals. Information sharing and communication between devices over different topologies is possible with Wi-Fi or TCP/IP Ethernet.</p>

        <h2>When to use a LAN:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have many users needing to connect at a single location.</li>
            <li>When devices and resources need to communicate directly with one another within a small geographic area.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>When not to use a LAN:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Connecting users across vast distances, such as in separate cities.</li>
            <li>If you don’t have control over the assets connecting to your network, you may want to be cautious on setting up a LAN for them to communicate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Advantages and disadvantages of Lan</h2>

                <td>All the resources are attached to one network and if any computer needs any resources then it can be shared with the required computer. Types of resources are the DVD drive, printers, scanners, modems and hard drives. So there is no need to purchase separate resources for each computer and it saves money.</td>
                <td>Data security problem</td>
                <td>If the server computer is not set up correctly and there is a leak in security then unauthorized users can access the data also. So there should be privacy policy and rules set up correctly on the server.</td>

                    <td>Client and server relationship</td>
                    <td>All the data from attached computers can be stored in one server. If any computer (Client) needs data then that computer user can simply log in and access the data from the server. For example movies and songs can be stored on the server and can be accessed by any authorized user (Client computer).</td>
                    <td>Limitation of distance</td>
                    <td>Local area networks are usually made within a building or nearby building and cannot extend to the wider area.</td>

                    <td>Sharing of the internet</td>
                    <td>In offices and net cafes, we can see that one internet connection is shared between all computers. This is also the type of LAN technology in which main internet cable is attached to one server and distributed amoung attached computers by the operating system.</td>
                    <td>Server crashes may affect all computers</td>
                    <td>If any file on the server is corrupted or hard drive fails then all the attached computers face problems in functioning properly.</td>

                    <td>Securing of data</td>
                    <td>Keeping data on the server is more secure. And if you want to change or remove any data you can do it easily on one server computer and other computers can access updated data. You can also give access or revoke access to specific users so that only authorized users can access the data in the network.</td>
                    <td>Setting up a LAN is expensive</td>
                    <td>It is expensive to set up LAN because there is special software required to make a server. Also, communication devices like hubs, switches, routers, cables are costly. The special administrator is required to maintain and troubleshoot LAN for a large office.
