        <h1>Personal Area Network (PAN)</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>What is a personal area network?</h2>
        <p>A personal area network (PAN) is a short-range network topology designed for peripheral devices (usually 30ft) used by an individual. The purpose of these types of networks is to transmit data between devices without being necessarily connected to the internet.</p>
        <p>PANs can also be connected to LAN and higher level network types where one device acts as a gateway. An everyday example of PAN is a Bluetooth keyboard that’s connected to a smart TV, where the interface allows you to surf the internet, view recorded programs, and configure personal preferences.</p>
        <p>Personal area networks can either be wireless or wired. Wireless PANs are called WPANs and use close-range connectivity protocols such as Wi-Fi, ZigBee, infrared, and Bluetooth for data-centric applications. In the case of Bluetooth, network configurations can be piconet—involving a master and one or more slaves—or scatternets, which are interrelated piconets.</p>
        <p>Wired PANs, on the other hand, use universal serial bus (USB) and ThunderBolt. Like other network types, each connectivity protocol within a PAN is typically not directly compatible with other protocols.</p>

                <td>Personal area network does not require extra wire or space. For connecting two devices you only need to enable Bluetooth in both devices to start sharing data among them. For example, connecting wireless keyboard and mouse with the tablet through Bluetooth.</td>
                <td>Less distance range</td>
                <td>Signal range is maximum 10 meters which makes limitation for long distance sharing.</td>

                    <td>Interfere with radio signals</td>
                    <td>As personal area network also use infrared so it can interfere with radio signals and data can be dropped.</td>

                    <td>Cost effective</td>
                    <td>No extra wires are needed in this type of network. Also, no extra data charges are involved so PAN is an inexpensive way of communication.</td>
                    <td>Slow data transfer</td>
                    <td>Bluetooth and infrared have a slow data transfer rate as compared to another type of networks like LAN (local area network).</td>
