        <h1> WAN (Wide Area Network)</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>What is a wide area network?</h2>
        <p>A wide area network (WAN) is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area for the primary purpose of computer networking. Wide area networks are often established with leased telecommunication circuits.</p>
        <p>Businesses and schools and government entities use wide area networks to relay data to staff, students, clients, buyers, and suppliers from various locations across the world. In essence, this mode of telecommunication allows a business to effectively carry out its daily function regardless of location. The Internet may be considered a WAN.</p>

                <td>Wan covers a large geographical area of 1000 km or more If your office is in different cities or countries then you can connect your office branches through wan. ISP (Internet service provider) can give you leased lines by which you can connect different branch offices together.</td>
                <td>Security problems</td>
                <td>WAN has more security problem as compare to MAN and LAN. WAN has many technologies combined with each other which can create a security gap.</td>

You can get back up, support, and other useful data from the head office and all data are synchronized with all other office branche</td>

                    <td>As data transferred on the internet can be accessed and changed by hackers so firewall needs to be enabled in the computer. Some people can also inject a virus into the computer so antivirus software needs to be installed. Other security software also needs to be installed on different points in WAN.</td>
